# Super Smash Bros. for NES
Oh boy, aren't you excited! Imagine SSB was launched for Nintendo Entertainment Systems back in the late 80s. Well, this is what this game aims for!

## Grabs? Never heard of them...
If you thought Smash 64 had less features compared to later games of the saga, a 10-year older console isn't going to improve things.
The NES controller has 8 buttons, 6 of which can be used to play games (4 for the DPad, A & B). So expect even less features. The following list contains all the features that the game currently lacks/will lack once finished (play some fancy elevator music while you scroll down):
* Shields & Grabbing (no L/R buttons)
* Smash attacks (maybe added in a long future...)
* Ledge grabbing (maybe added in a long future...)
* Tethering
* Wall jumps
* Side B
* Throws (obviously)

Quite a long list, huh? Don't be scared though, the core of Smash will be still present on this game.
