For anyone curious, this is a little readme of the pre-alpha versions.

Pre-Alpha numbering scheme: 0.[major].[minor]_[revision]
*Note: [revision] may not be used always*

Pre-Alpha is basically a very small version, it can't even be considered as alpha. The game will probably go through lots of this versions, until it can be considered to be in alpha stage.
